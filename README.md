# UniVibe Platform Monorepo

This repository now bundles the complete UniVibe platform:

- **backend/** – Spring Boot REST API that powers the platform.
- **frontend/** – Client applications that consume the API.
  - **frontend/web** – Modern React web application.
  - **frontend/mobile** – Expo (React Native) mobile application.

The backend can be executed either locally with Maven or by reusing the provided Docker Compose setup. Both frontend applications share a unified design system that follows a minimalistic, modern aesthetic and provide a synchronized dark mode experience.

## Getting started on Ubuntu 22.04+

> The instructions below assume you have Git, Docker, Node.js (>=18), npm and the Expo CLI prerequisites installed. Each section lists the additional tools that may be required.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Finalback.git
   cd Finalback
   ```

2. **Backend** – follow the instructions in [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) to run the Spring Boot API with Docker Compose or Maven.

3. **Web frontend** – minimalistic React SPA with dark mode.
   ```bash
   cd frontend/web
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # adjust VITE_API_BASE_URL if your backend is not running on http://localhost:8080
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The development server listens on http://localhost:5173 by default. The build uses Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

4. **Mobile frontend** – Expo application with QR scanner and proximity privacy mode.
   ```bash
   cd ../mobile
   cp .env.example .env
   npm install
   npx expo prebuild --platform android  # required once to register native proximity plugin
   npx expo start
   ```
   Scan the QR code generated by Expo Go or run it on an Android emulator. The mobile client consumes the same REST API, stores tokens securely using Expo SecureStore, scans QR codes for event check-in and hides sensitive user data whenever the device proximity sensor is covered.

5. **Deployment** – CI/CD and infrastructure scripts can be extended from this monorepo. The frontend projects are production ready for platforms such as Vercel/Netlify (web) and Expo Application Services (mobile).

## Repository scripts

| Path | Command | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `backend/` | `./mvnw spring-boot:run` | Run API directly with Maven |
| `backend/` | `docker compose up --build` | Start the API + PostgreSQL stack |
| `frontend/web` | `npm run lint` | Lint the React codebase |
| `frontend/web` | `npm run test` | Execute Vitest unit tests |
| `frontend/mobile` | `npm run lint` | Run Expo + TypeScript lint checks |

## Architecture overview

The backend exposes a modular domain around events, registrations, notifications, surveys, chat and gamification. Both client applications share the same domain concepts:

- A centralized Axios instance with interceptors, cancellation support and automatic token refresh.
- Context providers for authentication, theming, toasts and global data caches.
- Pagination helpers that match the backend `Page<>` responses for events and notifications.
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback, retry logic and offline fallbacks.
- Dark/light mode toggle synchronized across layouts.

The mobile application adds native integrations:

- **Camera / QR scanner** powered by `expo-barcode-scanner` for event check-in.
- **Proximity sensor** (via `expo-proximity`) that hides sensitive profile data when the device is covered.
- **Location services** (via `expo-location`) to request contextual event recommendations.
